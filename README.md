Stanbol Entity Disambiguation using FOAF Co-reference
======================================================

This is the Stanbol enhacement engine developed as part of the GSoC 2013 project [1]. <br/>

The engine's main functionality is to increase the confidence of Entity-Annotations identified from previous engines, by using 2 fundamental techniques; <br/>
1. Processing co-referencing URI references in the Entities to detect connected-ness
2. Processing foaf:name comparison with fise:selected-text

The main objective of processing co-referencing URIs is to increase the confidence of the most 'connected' entity from the suggested entities. 
All URI/Reference type fields of the entities are extracted and processed to find co-references with other entities suggested. The most connected entity will have the most number of URI matches, and the disambiguated-confidence will be increased accordingly.

The second technique used is literal matching of foaf:name field of the entity with the fise:selected-texts in the content. With an exact match, the disambiguated-confidence will be increased. Finally the cumulative disambiguated-confidence is calculated and adjusted.

This engine requires Entity-Annotations extracted from previous engines, and entityhub pre-configured with FOAF entities. 
The entityhub-site: <code>foaf-site</code> created by indexing the btc2012 dataset including substantial amount of FOAF data can be found at [2]. Please go through the steps in the project's README to configure the 'foaf-site' in Stanbol entityhub and use it in the foaf-site-chain enhancement-chain. The new disambiguation-foaf engine will be used to extend the functionality of this enhancement-chain in this project. 

How to execute the engine:
--------------------------
1. Build the maven project using command : <code>mvn clean install</code> 
2. Start the Stanbol engine and install the bundle: <code>org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.engines.disambiguation.foaf-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> 
3. Configure the foaf-site-chain with the new disambiguation engine

The new engine is identified by : <code>disambiguation-foaf</code>
Please note that in addition to the foaf-site I have also used entitylinking with dbpedia in the foaf-site-chain to increase the amount of entitiies for disambiguation.
Therefore after configuring the enhancement-chain successfully the foaf-site-chain should look like below; <br/>
<pre>
Engines: langdetect, opennlp-sentence, opennlp-token, opennlp-pos, foaf-site-linking, opennlp-ner, dbpediaLinking, disambiguation-foaf
